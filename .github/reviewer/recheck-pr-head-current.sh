# A review job's last look before the paid model read: is the head this run
# was dispatched for still the PR's live head? Emits stale=true/false to
# GITHUB_OUTPUT. The owed-review re-check runs before the ~25s environment
# setup, so a push landing inside that window still buys a whole-diff read of a
# superseded head; this check closes the window from the other side, as close
# to the model call as the job can ask. A moved head means GitHub fired a
# synchronize run for the new head, and that run — queued behind this job's
# per-PR concurrency group — owns the read; if it never arrives, the findings
# gate stays red on the new head, the same fail-closed-and-visible outcome the
# review job's concurrency comment already accepts. Fails toward REVIEWING: an
# unanswerable query emits stale=false — losing a PR's only read is worse than
# one duplicate.
