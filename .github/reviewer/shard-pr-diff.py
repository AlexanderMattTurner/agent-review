"""Split a unified diff into per-file shards small enough for one model read.

The PR reviewer reads the whole diff in one context, so above roughly 12,000
lines (~13.6 tokens/line, measured) it no longer fits and the review is skipped
entirely.

Shards never split a file. A reviewer handed half a hunk cannot tell an unsafe
change from a truncation, so a file bigger than the shard budget gets its own
oversize shard instead: still a complete file, just a larger read. The caller
sees `oversize` in the manifest and can decide.

Emits into --out-dir: `shard-NN.diff` per shard plus `manifest.json` carrying the
per-shard line counts and file lists, and the totals a review's coverage line is
built from. With GITHUB_OUTPUT set, also emits `shard_count` and `shards` (a JSON
array of shard basenames, for a workflow matrix).

Exit codes: 0 on success, OVER_BUDGET_EXIT when the diff needs more than
--max-shards shards (the caller falls back to a human-review notice), 1 on an
input that is not a diff at all.
