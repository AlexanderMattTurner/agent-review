# Shared exponential-backoff retry for every CI script.
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — a retry that cannot tell a blip from an answer. A linter, scanner or test
# runner reports what it FOUND through its exit code, which a blanket retry then replaces.
#
# Source it and call `retry CMD [args…]`, or `retry_stdout CMD` inside a command
# substitution. Tune per call site with:
#   RETRY_MAX         attempts before giving up (default 5)
#   RETRY_BASE_DELAY  first backoff in seconds; doubles each attempt (default 2)
#   RETRY_EXIT_CODES  space-separated exit codes that are retryable; empty (the default)
#                     retries every nonzero exit. zizmor sets it to 1, its tool-error code,
#                     so its finding code 14 is reported once rather than re-run.
#   RETRY_STOP_EXIT_CODES  the inverse — codes that are NEVER retryable, every other nonzero
#                     code still retried. apt_net's spent-budget refusal sets it.
#   RETRY_GH_BUDGET   `1` when the retried command spends the GitHub API budget under a name
#                     this loop cannot recognize as `gh` — a shell function wrapping it.
#   RETRY_STOP_ON_VALIDATION_REFUSAL  `1` when every field of the retried request is
#                     fixed, so GitHub's 422 is about bytes no attempt changes. Default
#                     `0`: some endpoints answer 422 for a spammed endpoint too.
#   RETRY_ON_SPENT_BUDGET  `1` when an inner loop's spent-budget stand-down is worth the
#                     caller's own remaining attempts — an idempotent script whose job has
#                     the minutes to outlast an installation-wide exhaustion. Default `0`.
# It does NOT set shell options — the caller owns `set -e`/pipefail.

# Guard against double-source (a script that sources this AND a lib that also does).
# This file is only ever sourced, so a top-level `return` is well-defined.
