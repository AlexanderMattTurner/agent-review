# Post the review agent's structured findings as ONE GitHub PR review with inline, line-anchored
# comments and (where offered) one-click suggested edits. post-pr-review.mjs builds the reviews-API
# payload from review.json; this posts it.
#
# The reviews API is ALL-OR-NOTHING, so one comment GitHub refuses throws away a read that costs
# tens of dollars — and throws it away INVISIBLY, because an issue comment is not a review:
# decide-pr-review-trigger.sh then reads the PR as never reviewed and the next push buys the whole
# read again, while review_findings_gate.py holds the merge on a review sitting right there. A
# rejection therefore DEGRADES: each finding posts as its own comment, so a bad anchor costs one
# finding, and the summary posts as a real COMMENT review, which is what records the read. Any
# finding still refused raises the needs-a-human hold, so the gate cannot green on findings nobody
# can resolve.
#
# Requires: gh authenticated (GH_TOKEN), GH_REPO, PR, PR_INPUT_DIR; node with the scripts on the
# module path. HEAD_SHA (the PR head sha) pins the review to the reviewed commit, and the degraded
# path needs it to anchor a comment at all.
