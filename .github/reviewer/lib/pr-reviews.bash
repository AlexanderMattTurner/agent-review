# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the
#   runner itself, so it has no entry point off a runner.
# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set shell options.
#
# The PR review read, in ONE place: the GraphQL document, the reviewer filter, and
# the latest-by-submittedAt fold that together answer "what has the automated
# reviewer posted on this PR?". Every step that asks that question goes through
# these helpers, so no caller can ship a `reviews(first: 100)` with no cursor — a
# query that returns the OLDEST 100 reviews and reports a stale state as the live
# one — nor a fold that picks by array order instead of submittedAt.
#
# Consumers: decide-pr-review-trigger.sh, recheck-pr-review-owed.sh,
# review_findings_gate.py.

# retry_stdout: sourced here rather than assumed, so a consumer gets the retry
# ladder by sourcing this file alone. lib-ci-retry.sh guards against double-source.

# $endCursor + pageInfo are what make `gh api graphql --paginate` able to walk:
# gh feeds the previous page's endCursor back in and stops on hasNextPage=false.
# Drop either and gh has no cursor to advance, so it returns page one forever —
# and page one of `reviews` is the OLDEST page, so an unpaginated query on a
# long-lived PR reports a superseded review as the current state.

# Empty-body reviews are excluded HERE, in the one shared read: GitHub synthesizes a
# body-less COMMENTED review around every standalone review-comment POST, and counting one
# as a review both spends the one-review-per-PR budget and satisfies the review-findings
# gate's reviewed-at-all condition vacuously. The real reviewer never posts an empty body.

# database ids exceed Int32, which GraphQL's Int-typed databaseId errors on.

# The caller must EXPORT REVIEWER_LOGIN_BARE: the jq reads it out of `env`, and GraphQL
# returns an app bot's login WITHOUT the REST `[bot]` suffix.
