# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body no test runs — it reads runner-only context or provisions the runner itself.
# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set shell options.
# The PR review-thread read, in ONE place: the GraphQL document plus the
# `gh api graphql --paginate` call that walks it. INVARIANT: every step that needs a PR's review threads goes through fetch_review_threads, so no caller can ship a `reviewThreads(first: 100)` with no cursor — a query that silently drops every thread past the first page and reports the truncated slice as the whole set. Callers differ only in the jq they project each page's nodes through.
#
# Consumers: review_findings_gate.py, prepare-merge-delta-input.sh, post-merge-delta-review.sh.
#
# API:
#   fetch_review_threads <owner> <name> <pr> <jq> [comments-per-thread] — walk EVERY page, applying <jq> to each page's nodes ARRAY. Non-zero once retries exhaust.
#   raise_human_review_finding <marker> <prose-file> — open ONE file-level finding thread stamped <marker>, unless an UNRESOLVED thread already carries it. Requires GH_REPO, PR, HEAD_SHA and an exported REVIEWER_LOGIN_BARE.
#   settled_merge_delta_shas <owner> <name> <pr> — every merge sha a merge-delta finding thread was raised about, replied to by a non-reviewer, and resolved.

# retry_stdout, sourced here rather than assumed, so a consumer gets the retry ladder by
# sourcing this file alone. lib-ci-retry.sh guards against a double source.
# shellcheck source=.github/reviewer/lib-ci-retry.sh
source "$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)/lib-ci-retry.sh"

# `$endCursor` and `pageInfo` are what let `gh api graphql --paginate` walk: gh feeds endCursor back in and stops on hasNextPage=false, so drop either and it has no cursor to advance and returns page one forever, reporting a truncated thread set as the whole one. That set feeds the review-findings merge gate, so an under-read greens a gate that should be red.
# A comment's own fullDatabaseId is the REST id of that comment, which is what a consumer needs to EDIT a thread's root comment (`pulls/comments/<id>`); a string, for the same Int32 reason as the review id below. The node selection is the UNION of what the consumers project, because one shared document is the point. `comments` is the one field whose per-page cost is proportional to its size, so it is a variable: a caller keying on who OPENED each thread takes the root comment alone, and one rendering the whole conversation asks for more.

# PROBLEM CLASS — the reviewer read the PR but could not report its findings as inline
# threads, so the gate would go green with nothing for anyone to resolve. Two consumers raise
# the same hold: post-oversized-review.sh (the diff is too large to read at all) and
# post-pr-review.sh (GitHub rejected the structured review, so some finding has no thread of
# its own). MARKER stamps a gating thread that ONLY ITS OWNER may resolve — the generic LLM
# thread resolver excludes a thread carrying one, because it reads only the PR diff and a
# "does the diff resolve this?" judgement would clear an evil-merge or needs-a-human hold the
# diff cannot speak to. The caller writes the prose; this appends the marker, the resolver
# exemption and the blocking severity, so no caller can raise a hold the LLM resolver may
# clear or the gate may ignore. It anchors to the PR's first changed file with
# subject_type=file: the concern is PR-wide, and all the gate needs is a RESOLVABLE thread.

# post-merge-delta-review.sh keeps it out of a fresh finding's scope. THREE gates, each
# closing a way a merge could be retired without anyone judging it:
#   * The reviewer must be the thread's ROOT author, because the stamp is an HTML comment
#     invisible in a rendered body — without this, anyone who can comment could plant one and
#     retire a merge nobody looked at.
#   * The thread must carry a REPLY from someone other than the reviewer, which puts the
#     finding's escape hatch in evidence rather than in identity: the hold is cleared by
#     tracing each flagged hunk to a parent IN A REPLY and then resolving, so resolving in
#     silence must not buy the same result. It is an existence check, never a judgement of the
#     reply's prose. The
#     reviewer's own replies do not count: a bot cannot answer for the actor whose resolution
#     is under review.
#   * The thread must be RESOLVED. The reply gate alone prices the hold at a comment, and any
#     commenter can pay it, including one who replies to object. Resolving is the deliberate
#     act that says the evidence in the reply settles the merge.
# Fails in the RAISE direction: an exhausted thread query yields an empty set, so nothing is
