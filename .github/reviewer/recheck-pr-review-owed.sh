# The group serializes review JOBS only, and a sharded review is posted later by
# review_synthesis (its own group) — so a submitted-reviews read alone still
# races the sharded path, and an earlier run of this workflow with a live
# shard/synthesis job on this PR also counts as the read being spent — that job,
# not the umbrella run around it. Fails toward REVIEWING: an exhausted
# query emits skip=false — losing a PR's only read is worse than one duplicate.
