"""The one exponential-backoff retry loop for a CI command, ported from
``.github/reviewer/lib-ci-retry.sh``.

PROBLEM CLASS — a flaky CI command (a ``gh`` call against a 5xx-ing API, a
network read) must be re-run with exponential backoff, under one spelling of the
``RETRY_MAX`` and ``RETRY_BASE_DELAY`` knobs and one wording of the two
``ci-retry:`` log lines a human greps the job log for. Import this instead of
writing the loop again: a second copy drifts in how it READS the knobs, and a
knob that works in one script and raises in another is not a knob.

The caller keeps what genuinely differs between call sites: how one attempt is
run and captured, and what an exhausted retry means — an empty answer, or a
raise. Both are arguments.

Standard library only: the jobs that run these scripts check out
``.github/reviewer`` and use the system ``python3``.

    the answer the caller asked for — a 404 meaning "not configured". A reader

    expected answer. It never silences the per-attempt retry lines, so a call
    that really did retry still says so.

    is deadline-blind on purpose: a caller with its OWN wall-clock budget owns
    what happens when a wait would outlast it, and passing that decision in is
    what keeps a rate-limit wait measured in an hour from ending as a job
