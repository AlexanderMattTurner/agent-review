# kcov-exclude: a step body with a behavioral suite that runs the real script
#   against stubbed CLIs on PATH, asserting branches without tracing a run.
# Decide whether the PR reviewer (the `review` job in review.yaml) runs for this
# pull_request_target event. Writes run=true/false to GITHUB_OUTPUT. The model is
# the reusable workflow's `model` input and is not decided here.
#
# Budget: ONE whole-diff read per PR; a later push is not re-read. The
# review-findings gate holds the merge on the threads that read opened;
# resolving an addressed one is the session's own job, not an automated
# re-read. [opus-review] is the escape valve for a head that needs a fresh look.
#
# Runs for every PR whatever its base, so a stacked child cannot merge with the
# review gate red.
#
# A DRAFT is reviewed like any other PR. The ready-PR cap drafts most PRs within
# seconds of `opened`, so a reviewer that waited for `ready_for_review` gave feedback
# only once the work was finished — when it is worth the least.
#
# Triggers: `opened` always fires. `ready_for_review` / `synchronize` fire only when:
# (1) "[opus-review]" is in the head commit TITLE, bounded to once per tagged commit,
# opted in by a PUSH alone; (2) the reviewer left no review at all, re-arming `opened`
# after an oversized diff or a cancelled job.
#
# Security: read under pull_request_target, so the untrusted head is never
# checked out or executed, and matched only as fixed DATA strings (never eval).
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN, ACTION, REPO, HEAD_SHA, PR.
