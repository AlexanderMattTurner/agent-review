// Fold the per-shard review.json files of a sharded PR review into the ONE
// review.json that post-pr-review.mjs expects, so an oversized PR gets a single
// posted review rather than N.
//
// The merge is deliberately dumb — concatenate findings, concatenate summaries
// — because every shard read a disjoint slice of the
// same diff, so there is nothing to reconcile between them. Anchoring is
// unaffected: post-pr-review.mjs resolves each finding against the FULL diff.txt,
// which every shard's findings are still coordinates into.
//
// It fails loud when the number of shard reviews does not match the manifest's
// shard count. That check is the whole point: the posted review states how many
// lines were read, and a silently-missing shard would turn that coverage line
// into a false claim of a complete read.
