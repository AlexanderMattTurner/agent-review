# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body with a behavioral suite: the suite runs the real
#   script as `bash <script>` against stubbed CLIs on PATH, so the branches are asserted but
#   no run is ever traced.
# Fetch the untrusted PR diff + metadata and run them through the
# agent-sanitizer (sanitize-pr-input.mjs) BEFORE the review agent sees them.
# The agent reads only the sanitized files this writes, never the raw
# `gh pr diff`, so an injection payload hidden in the diff cannot reach it intact.
#
# Above MAX_DIFF_LINES the diff no longer fits one model context, so this
# SHARDS it per-file and emits the shard list for parallel reads. Only a diff
# too large even to shard falls back to the human-review notice. The >300-file
# case (GitHub refuses the diff media type outright) is rebuilt from the files
# API first, then routed by size like any other.
#
# Requires: gh authenticated (GH_TOKEN/GH_REPO), node + `pnpm install` done.
# Emits to GITHUB_OUTPUT: diff_lines, sharded, unreviewable, shards, shard_count
# (the last two written by shard-pr-diff.py). Writes into $PR_INPUT_DIR:
# diff.txt/meta.txt, sanitizer-report.txt, shards/, oversized-notice.txt.
