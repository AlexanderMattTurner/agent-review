"""Behavioral tests for .github/reviewer/prepare-pr-review-input.sh — the step
that fetches the untrusted PR diff/metadata, sanitizes them for the Opus
reviewer, and routes the review by diff size.

Contract:
  * EVERY diff is sanitized — diff.txt/meta.txt are always written, and the
    shards must be slices of exactly the bytes a reviewer would otherwise have
    read.
  * At or under MAX_DIFF_LINES: sharded=false, unreviewable=false, no shards.
  * Over MAX_DIFF_LINES: the sanitized diff is split per file into shards/ and
    sharded=true, so the largest PRs are reviewed in a fan-out instead of being
    skipped for a human who may never look.
  * Over MAX_SHARDS shards: unreviewable=true and the human-review notice —
    the only remaining no-review path.

The tests drive the REAL script with a fake `gh` (emits an N-file unified diff /
PR metadata) and a fake `node` (stands in for the sanitizer, passing stdin
through) on PATH, so the routing itself is exercised, not a re-implementation.
The sharder runs for real.
