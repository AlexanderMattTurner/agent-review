"""Behavioral tests for .github/reviewer/post-oversized-review.sh — the step
that keeps an oversized PR mergeable through a HUMAN sign-off: it posts the
oversized notice as a real COMMENT review (satisfying the review-findings
gate's reviewed-at-all leg) plus ONE 🔴 file-level finding thread whose
human resolution is what greens the gate.

Idempotent per surface: the notice review is posted once per PR (keyed on the
`<!-- oversized-review -->` marker), and the finding thread is re-raised only
when no UNRESOLVED marker-stamped one exists — a human's resolution is never
clobbered, while a still-oversized re-read after a resolve raises a fresh
thread for the new head.

Drives the REAL script (sourcing the real lib-ci-retry.sh and
lib/review-threads.bash) with a fake `gh` on PATH that serves the reads
(reviews list, review threads, PR files) from canned JSON by running the
script's OWN --jq programs through REAL jq — so the marker matching is
exercised, never re-implemented — and records every POST's path and fields
(resolving `-F body=@file` to the file's bytes) for assertion. gh is stubbed
because there is no live GitHub to ask; node shapes mirror the REST reviews
list and REVIEW_THREADS_QUERY in lib/review-threads.bash.
