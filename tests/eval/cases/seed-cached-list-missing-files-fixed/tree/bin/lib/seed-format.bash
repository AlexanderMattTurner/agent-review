# parts a `git clone` cannot. Three processes hand the launch folder to the cell and each one
# would otherwise spell the answer itself: the launch's own seed build (sbx/resume-overlay.bash),
# the Mac carrier (lima-clone.sh) and the pack that makes the image (clone.bash).
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — a clone carries COMMITS ONLY. The tree the user launched from also holds
# uncommitted edits to tracked files and files git has never been told about, and a session
# that starts without them starts on a tree the user does not recognise. Ignored files are the
# one part that stays behind on purpose: node_modules and .venv are the host's, built for the
# host's platform, and the cell installs its own.
#
# A leaf lib with no sources but the git wrapper, and bash 3.2-compatible: lima-clone.sh reaches
# it on a stock macOS shell.
