"""`.github/reviewer/shard-pr-diff.py` splits an oversized PR diff for review.

The load-bearing properties are reunion and atomicity: concatenating the shards
must reproduce the input byte-for-byte (nothing silently dropped from a review
that then reports full coverage), and no file's section may be split across two
shards (half a hunk reads like a complete change to a reviewer, which is worse
than not reviewing it).
