"""post-pr-review.sh's degraded path — what happens when GitHub refuses the
structured review as one payload.

The reviews API is all-or-nothing, so one comment it will not take rejects a
read that cost tens of dollars and half an hour of fan-out. The degraded path
must (1) post each finding as its own review comment, so one bad anchor costs
one finding, (2) record the read as a real COMMENT review, which is what stops
decide-pr-review-trigger.sh buying the whole read again on the next push, and
(3) raise a human-review hold when a finding was still lost, so
review_findings_gate.py cannot green on findings nobody can resolve.

Nothing here is stubbed: the real `post-pr-review.sh` runs the real
`post-pr-review.mjs` over a real review.json and diff, and the real `gh` posts
to a localhost GitHub (FakeReviewPoster) that answers the 422. That boundary is
the point — a `gh` stub would be this file's own belief about how a refusal
reaches the script, which is exactly the belief under test.
