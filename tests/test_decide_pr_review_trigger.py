"""Behavioral tests for .github/reviewer/decide-pr-review-trigger.sh — the gate
that decides whether review.yaml's reviewer runs. The model is the reusable
workflow's own input, so this script never picks one.

Contract:
  * a DRAFT is decided exactly like a ready PR — the script never reads the draft
    state at all. The ready-PR cap drafts most PRs within seconds of `opened`, so
    a reviewer that waited for `ready_for_review` would give its feedback only
    once the work was finished.
  * opened -> always run (its first review). GitHub fires this action exactly
    once per pull request, which is what makes an unconditional arm here safe.
  * ready_for_review / synchronize -> run when EITHER
      1. the event is a `synchronize` AND the head commit's TITLE (subject line,
         not body) carries the "[opus-review]" opt-in (matched
         case-insensitively) -> a full re-read. A `ready_for_review` never opts
         in: a toggle carries no new commit, so honoring it would buy one read
         per toggle off a single tagged head; or
      2. the reviewer bot has left NO review at all — the first pass never
         produced one, so this event is it.
    A PR gets ONE automated review. Any existing verdict — APPROVED, DISMISSED,
    or a still-outstanding CHANGES_REQUESTED or COMMENTED — means the read is
    spent, and no repeatable event buys another; only the [opus-review] opt-in
    does. Both `ready_for_review` and `synchronize` can fire without limit on one
    PR, so an unconditional arm on either costs a whole-diff Opus read per fire.
  * the base branch never decides anything: a PR based on a feature branch is
    reviewed exactly like one based on the default branch. Enforcement matches —
    a second ruleset requires the same checks over `claude/**` — so a merged
    stacked child brings in no unread code and buys no re-read.
  * `recheck` is true for trigger 2 alone — that read can race a review still
    being generated, so the review job re-asks the question from inside its
    concurrency group (see test_recheck_pr_review_owed.py).
  * any other action -> never run.
  * the head commit message is fetched via `gh api .../commits/<sha>` and the
    review state via lib/pr-reviews.bash's shared GraphQL read, read as DATA; a
    `gh` failure yields run=false (no review, no red), never a spurious re-review.

The tests drive the REAL script with a fake `gh` on PATH so the decision logic
(not a re-implementation) is exercised; one test pins that the script actually
head-scopes its API query.
